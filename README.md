## Pumpfun smart contract for pump.fun fork, implemented all main functionalities of pump fun.
This pumpfun smart contract forked pump.fun, but it's developed to give basic understanding about pump fun.

## Achievements in advanced version
#### All handled in smart contracts Pumpfun uses backend client code to fetch buy transaction and create raydium pool. I've handled all that parts on smart contract to enhance the security and availability.
#### Added some launch phases There's some phases to launch a token like Presale. If the users want to snipe a token, they can bid for the token in Presale phase before Launch.
#### Raydium/Meteora Token launchers can migrate their tokens to Raydium or Migrate as their wish after the curve is completed.
